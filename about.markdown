# Who are you?

I often ask this question as a side effect of overabundance of alone time. If you figure it out who I am, then ~~tell me~~ keep it to yourself and do not spoil the fun.

# Where are you going?

Always forward.

# How is it going?

It is going.

# What are your interests?

My primary interests lie in the spectrum of natural sciences, compsci and mathematics. I also enjoy sifting through hard sci-fi worldbuilding (my favorite so far is [Orion's Arm](https://orionsarm.com)) and playing sandbox and simulation games, particularly Minecraft. There was a time in the past when I dabbled in computer graphics, although I quickly realized I don't have a soul of an artist - I focused more on shiny technical stuff than making things artistic. I was also a member of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) community, a time which I remember very fondly and am proud of.

# Why blog?

I wanted to start a blog for a long time, but I couldn't think of something worth writing about. I finally decided to just start and let things happen, without direction and theme. This blog is my space of personal expression rather than a blog about something specific.

# What are you doing now?

I'm working on my bachelor's, but in the meantime I plan on writing something here if I manage to.

# What is your rig?

* hardware: ThinkPad E15 Gen 2 AMD  
* specs: AMD Ryzen 5 4500U, ~23 GiB RAM  
* software: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) x86_64; GNOME Wayland
